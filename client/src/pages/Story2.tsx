You feel the weight of destiny pressing upon your shoulders, and as you glance around the tavern, the flickering candles cast ghostly shadows on the walls. The villagers raise their tankards in merriment, oblivious to the danger lurking just beyond their doorsteps. Their laughter rings hollow in your ears as you step outside into the cool embrace of the evening air.\n\nThe Darkwood Forest looms before you, its gnarled trees twisting like the fingers of ancient giants reaching toward the heavens. The moonlight filters through the branches, casting an ethereal glow that dances on the damp earth beneath your feet. Following the map closely, you tread carefully along a narrow, winding path, the whispers of the trees brushing against your ear like a warning.\n\nAs you venture deeper into the forest, the sounds of the village fade away, replaced by the rustle of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. Suddenly, an eerie silence envelops you, as if the forest itself is holding its breath. You pause to study the map, tracing the route with your finger, when a low growl echoes through the darkness. The underbrush stirs, and from the shadows emerges a creature of nightmare â€” a shadow wolf, eyes like burning coals and teeth gleaming like daggers.\n\nYour heart races as the wolf circles, its intent clear.'
